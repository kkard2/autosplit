# autosplit

automatical livesplit splitting for comedic purposes

## usage
RMB > Edit layout... > + > Control > Scriptable Auto Splitter

then

Layout Settings > Scriptable Auto Splitter > Browse to autosplit.asl

you need to edit autosplit.asl to suit your use case (it should be obvious
how to do that when you read the file)

then after you create your splits and manually start it should split at desired
timestamps

## rant

omg creating scriptable auto splitter is so cumbersome (mostly because of error
reporting USING EVENT LOGS)

i don't want anyone to go thru this process so steal my code (it took way too
long for what it's actually doing)
